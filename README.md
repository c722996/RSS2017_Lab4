For Lab 6, our assignment consisted of trajectory planning a path from a start pose to a goal pose and being able to follow the follow trajectories in the Stata basement. For the path planning, the objective was to be able to set the start and goal poses using RVIZ on a known occupancy grid map. We were given example trajectories representations, including piecewise and spline curves, as well as planning algorithm representations, including BFS, PRM, and RRT. For the trajectory tracking, the objective was implementing the particle filter localization from Lab 5 and the pure pursuit from Lab 4. Together with the safety controller, the robot should be able to navigate the planned trajectories reliably in the Stata Basement while avoiding any obstacles.
